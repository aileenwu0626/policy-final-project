            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                In terms of being transparent, the government does generally look to increase it to improve trust and 
                legitimacy for its reputation and duty towards its people. Big determiners in the release of information 
                are the fear of political backlash and how it could be used. Major concerns include general misuse, endangerment 
                of national security, and the possibility of information being used against the government. Citizens and other 
                civil society parties look to use the data to stay informed, hold the government accountable, and utilize the 
                FOI laws for improved awareness and tackle governmental issues. Concerned with outdated or biased information 
                reaching them, governmental data transparency is important because it ensures accuracy and integrity. Researchers, 
                the private sector, and policymakers seek to utilize accurate data for their respective interests in developing 
                products of intellect, information, policy, and improvement.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Recently, controversial governmental policies and calculated bills have been causing tension in its foundations, 
                along with the political climate, social movements, and the public’s reliance on its activities. With so much bias 
                embedded behind every agenda, every intention, the trust the people have in their national higher-ups has decreased 
                significantly in the past decade. Data collection and sources are hidden from the public eye, allowing for one-sided 
                political behavior and corruption to pursue. The citizens are also left less educated in their governmental affairs 
                and in crucial metrics than they should be, causing them to form uneducated stances and resentment, further 
                dissociating them from the government’s true intentions and misconstruing facts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During the earlier weeks of President Trump’s administration, a wide range of important information from the Census 
                Bureau, CDC, and EPA, ranging from webpages, datasets, and mapping tools, has been taken down (Munson, 2025), 
                increasing concerns about the government's reliability in disclosing federal data collection and integrity. One of the 
                most damaging incidents of data removal has been the Trump Administration’s attempt to remove federal data on gender 
                identity for the sake of suppressing DEI initiatives. Surveys, resources, archives, platforms, and clear agendas have 
                been lost in the process. It is hard for the public to recover its trust because a major factor is the government’s 
                ability to be clear about what they do and have.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Scope and Significance</h2>
            <p>
                It’s incredibly vital for federal information and statistics to be reliable to the citizens of a nation. A wide scope 
                of coordination, planning, researching, forecasting, and large-scale projects is based on the integrity of the people’s 
                information. Thus, finding, implementing, and enforcing a clear expression of open government data transparency for the 
                benefit of the nation’s trust, progress, and safety should be addressed immediately.
