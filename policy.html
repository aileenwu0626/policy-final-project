            <h2>Policy Options Considered</h2>
            <p>
                Fundamentally, there should be established uniform federal standards for non-sensitive information that should 
                be made available. Currently, different organizations and factions of the government have control over when and 
                what they publish. This allows for the inconsistencies and the selective disclosures that give way to establishing 
                misleading information and a lack thereof. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="option-box">
                <h3>Part 1: Establishing Federal Data Disclosure Standards and Oversight</h3>
                <p>
                    The first recommendation is that a federal act be past on requiring a minimum data disclosure standard for every 
                    federal agency with time-mandated updates for non-sensitive information. From a more cohesive standpoint, it 
                    promotes a default string of information that is guaranteed to the public, including concerns up for further 
                    investigation or acknowledgment with future details. An investigative office of data integrity should be established 
                    to enforce compliance and report violations, misinformation, and accountability measures to Congress and the public. 
                    Whenever information is to be taken down, replaced, or documented, responsible parties should post visible notices of 
                    the related activities and expected times for data reinstatement.

                <h3>Part 2: Balancing Transparency and Security in Federal Information Access</h3>
                <p>
                    At the same time, the nation has to find a balance between what should be released and what being released would harm 
                    the security of federal intel and the nation’s citizens. Using a council comprised of experts from multiple relevant 
                    groups on federal intelligence (ex., Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, academia), two to three 
                    general levels of information should be defined. Enforcement of releasing fully public data should include open datasets, 
                    budgets, environmental reports, and other general non-sensitive agency operations that citizens and other organizations 
                    can freely refer to. Other levels of more sensitive information can be placed under conditional access for researchers, 
                    journalists, and other oversight bodies through a secure conditional system. In general, secrecy should only be temporary 
                    for the right reasons. Transparency and accountability include being crystal clear about the whens and wheres of all 
                    activity related to the information in mind.

                <h3>Part 3: Leveraging AI for Automated and Transparent Government Data Release</h3>
                <p>
                    The implementation of AI/machine learning models and data tools can help default and automate the release of government 
                    datasets in an easily accessible form for the public and researchers to access. The planners and specialists can agree on 
                    the data that deserves to be published by default, thus programming AI to be able to read, clean, and format the data to 
                    automatically be accessible, lessening the interactions between the government and the process of determining whether or 
                    not to release it. In this way, it gives the government less leeway to formulate data-backed agendas and manipulate how 
                    or what fundamental data is configured and released.

            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
                My final recommendation incorporates all three policy options as multiple cogs of one functioning system. The federal government should establish a 
                comprehensive Automated Open Government Data Framework that mandates minimum disclosure standards for all federal agencies while protecting 
                legitimate national security interests through a tiered classification system enforced by an independent Office of Data Integrity. This 
                framework would utilize AI and machine learning to automatically process, format, and publish non-sensitive government data on regular 
                schedules. A multi-stakeholder council of intelligence, 
                security, and civil liberties experts would define clear access levels—ranging from fully public datasets to conditionally accessible 
                materials for credentialed researchers and journalists—with all classification decisions subject to time limits and periodic review. 
                Any modifications to published data would require visible public notices explaining the rationale and timeline, ensuring that transparency 
                and accountability remain the default while secrecy is permitted only when genuinely necessary and temporarily justified.
