                <h3>Case Study 1: Edward Snowden and U.S. Intelligence</h3>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, leaked and revealed classified 
                    documents that indicated mass surveillance data programs that the U.S. National Security Agency had in secret 
                    from Congress and the public. Containing records of mass interception of phone calls and electronic activities 
                    between U.S. citizens and foreign citizens, bringing light to collections incited debate on surveillance practices 
                    and the respect for citizen privacy.</p>
                <p><strong>Impacts:</strong> Since the leaks, 49% of Americans approved of releasing classified information for the reason 
                    that it served public interest. However, 54% of the public also believed that the government should legally pursue criminal 
                    charges against leakers (Geiger, 2018). The overall trend, however, suggests a greater distrust in the government’s ability 
                    to protect its citizens’ data and an even greater overall belief (57% of American citizens) that the government shouldn’t 
                    be able to monitor their private communications.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Lessons:</strong> This case plays a big role in calling attention to the trade-offs of secrecy in the name of 
                    national security and trust. The USA Freedom Act was passed to limit how the information collected was used, storing records 
                    only for relevant national investigative uses if issued a court order (Zetter, 2015). It shows the importance of transparency 
                    policies to take form with concerns of both being fair and open to the citizens, while preserving security. Data tools can be 
                    restricted in their accessibility to organizations and groups that are determined not to have the right to free access. At 
                    the same time, being in possession of certain information can be useful and give citizens assurance that the government has 
                    more control over aspects of their safety and privacy.</p>

                <h3>Case Study 2: Flint Water Crisis</h3>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> The City of Flint, Michigan had changed its water supply in 2014 from Great Lakes’ Lake Huron to 
                    the Flint River in efforts to save money by relying on a cheaper water supplier. The issue with the transition was that the 
                    necessary precautions and corrosion control treatment were not taken, leading to lead poisoning through the pipage that 
                    would put the health of thousands of households at risk. Facts and figures were not clearly shared, and necessary actions 
                    were taken far too late.</p>
                <p><strong>Impacts:</strong> The major issue began when the water tests resulted in Flint being in violation of the Safe Drinking 
                    Water Act, and the absence of corrosion control treatment was reported to the EPA. The Michigan Department of Environmental 
                    Quality had excluded two lead level samples from their initial report, which put them in federal mandate levels (Kennedy, 2016). 
                    In the process of the city’s recovery, children have already been tested to being exposed to concerningly high levels of lead. 
                    Overall acknowledgment of the issues and lack of precaution had been downplayed, eventually leading to irreversible health 
                    effects like the outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease (University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health, 2019).</p>
                <p><strong>Key Lessons:</strong> The Flint incident shows how delaying or releasing inaccurate official data can embed a long 
                    legacy of distrust in the operators and organizations responsible for the health and quality of the public and its environment 
                    and resources. Without fully disclosing initial setbacks and taking responsibility for them, related professionals and 
                    researchers will have a harder time responding in time to help with figuring out solutions to problems and implementing actions. 
                    Policies should revolve around mandatory testing/reporting protocols for hazardous environmental risks, regardless of concerns 
                    about backlash and how marginal issues may seem. All relevant findings should be requested and reported without omission of any 
                    information.</p>
